Pano,

This task was more challenging. Furthermore, I think I'll be seeing 'role' and 'aria-controls' in my nightmares!

I tried to experiment with all these new classes and that resulted in some deviations from TCB's examples. I omitted some things (left comments in place though) that don't seem to make a difference.
(In other words, I found and removed all these redundant screws! Wait, what's that smoke coming out of the machine??)

I've included some feedback in the feedback.md file. Would you prefer to receive it via email/slack instead?

Best,
Nikos
