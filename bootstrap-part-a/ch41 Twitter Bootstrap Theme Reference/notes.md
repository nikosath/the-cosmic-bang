Pano,

This task was more challenging. Furthermore, I think I'll be seeing 'role' and 'aria-controls' in my nightmares!

I tried to experiment with all these new classes and that resulted in some deviations from TCB's examples. I omitted some things (left comments in place though) that don't seem to make a difference.
(In other words, I found and removed all these redundant screws! Wait, what's that smoke coming out from the machine??)

I've included some feedback in the feedback.md file. Would you prefer to receive it via email/slack instead?

Best,
Nikos

Good day Pano,

> However, there is a difference between your version and the version that includes the div wrapper. See the attached pictures. I personally like the one with the div in. Am I wrong?

Well, you know, it's a matter of different taste! No, I am kidding, it definitely looks better with that extra div. Nice find! I've fixed it.

> 2) I like the "dark-background" div. Nice!

:-D

> 3) Just a note. I have put as first element child of body, the carousel and not the navigation bar. You have put the navigation bar and then the carousel. Did you find it more intuitive?

Yes. It didn't cross my mind to put the carousel first.

Thanks,
Nikos
