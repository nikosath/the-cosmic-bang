        Perovskia atriplicifolia is a deciduous perennial subshrub with an erect to spreading habit.[13][27] Superficially, it resembles a much larger version of lavender.[28] Multiple branches arise from a shared rootstalk,[8] growing to a height of 0.5–1.2 m (1 ft 8 in–3 ft 11 in), [8][22] with occasional specimens reaching 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in).[4] The mature plant may be 0.6–1.2 m (2 ft 0 in–3 ft 11 in) across.[4] The rigid stems are square in cross-section,[4] and are covered by a indumentum formed by stellate, or star-shaped, trichomes and oil droplets.[27] Especially during autumn, these hairs give the stems a silvery appearance.[29]
